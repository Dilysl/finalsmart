        Why do you want to save money?<br><br>
        Do you have a savings account? <br><br>
        Where are you going to save your money? <br><br>
        Have you ever saved money before?<br><br>
        How much can you afford to save?<br><br>
        How much do you spend on a weekly basis?

          <h2>Savings Account Information:</h2>
          <p>Consider these three types of financial institutions when researching a savings account:<br><br>

<p>Banks<br>
The biggest banks often seem appealing due to their abundance of branches, well-known brands, and variety of services, but they also tend to offer very low rates on savings accounts.</p><br>

<p>Credit unions<br>
Credit unions tend to offer higher rates than banks for share accounts (their term for a basic savings account). You may need to meet certain membership requirements to join, however.</p><br>

<p>Online/internet banks<br>
As a whole, high yield savings accounts at online banks maintain the best rates. The primary drawback is that, unlike a traditional brick-and-mortar bank or credit union, you canâ€™t simply walk into a local branch for assistance.</p></p>
